Now using plumbob, chances of adding and removing layers and nodes are now equal, there is a penalty of 0.00001 food/tick/node that an agent has, angent colour is now based on the sum of their network weights


- Food
	- Drop from agents
		- Constant value
		- Percentage of health
	- Health

- Agent senses
- God features
	- Save, Copy, move, delete agents
- Graphs
	- Max Population Text
	- Colour
- To try tab/notifications
	- Mass extinction is a big factor in evolution
- Neural Networks
	- Propagation animation
- Settings
	- Water damage/mutate
	- Node hunger loss penalty
- Fix thrashing
- Particles
