DONE
Changed node penalty to 0.0000005 and mutateStrucProb to 0.01, added attack output and input, variable and health slider, water decreases health by 0.1/tick & cant reproduce in water, agent dies if no hunger or health, 2/3 chance to add a connection to a node in the previous layer & 25% less for every prev layer (as new layers never formed connections & destroyed old connections too fast so never good)
