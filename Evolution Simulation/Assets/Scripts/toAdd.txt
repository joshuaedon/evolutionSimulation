DONE
Reduced starting grass to 0.5, increased starting agents 3-fold, grassSpawnAmount changed to be per 100^2 points


- Food
	- Spawn type
		- Grass spread
		- Fruit spawn
		- Drop from agents
			- Constant value
			- Percentage of health
	- Health
		- Agent attack
	- Make spawn rate dependent on area of land
	- Change spawn time to spawn rate
- Breeding
	- Type
- Agent senses
- God features
	- Vertex objects must be deleted when !showVertices
	- Raise/lower land
	- Add/remove food
	- Save, Copy, move, delete agents
- Graphs
	- Population
	- Colour
- To try tab/notifications
	- Mass extinction is a big factor in evolution
- Neural Networks
	- Change so weights go across multiple layers
	- Propagation animation
	- Mutate weights tend to 0
- Breed agent button & mutate button

- Setup menu


BUGS
- Can't click through statistics element
- Fix positions for different screen dimentions
- terainUpdate variable







- How hard is the machine learning cw?
- Are they expecting us to have finished out projects completely by the presentation?
