DONE
weightDecay changed to 0.999, maxWeight displayed in the agent panel, agents record their generation and it is displayed, set starting grass to 0.25 to reduce mass replication at the beginning, varying mutate amount, implemented agent colour. Quite stable with no water. GETS STUCK IN LOOP SOMETIMES FOR UNKNOWN REASON

- To try tab/notifications
	- Mass extinction is a big factor in evolution
- Neural Networks
	- Change so weights go across multiple layers
	- Propagation animation
	- Mutate weights tend to 0

BUGS
- Can't click through statistics element
- Fix positions for different screen dimentions
- terainUpdate variable







- How hard is the machine learning cw?
- Are they expecting us to have finished out projects completely by the presentation?
