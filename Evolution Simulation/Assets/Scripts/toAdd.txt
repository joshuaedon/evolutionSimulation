DONE
Replaced chunk.vector with 3 variables and added yOffset, fexed vertex view (vertex center is where mouse hits sea floor), selecting agent now changes 'face' colour, changed defalut noise scale from 15 to 20 to widen land so agents have more room to spread at initial simulation stage, all agents no longer reproduce on their first tick, agent left and right were reversed, implementing god tools WIPds


- Food
	- Spawn type
		- Grass spread
		- Drop from agents
			- Constant value
			- Percentage of health
	- Health
		- Agent attack
- Agent senses
- God features
	- Vertex objects must be deleted when !showVertices
	- Raise/lower land
	- Add/remove food
	- Save, Copy, move, delete agents
- Graphs
	- Max Population Text
	- Colour
- To try tab/notifications
	- Mass extinction is a big factor in evolution
- Neural Networks
	- Change so weights go across multiple layers
	- Propagation animation
	- Mutate weights tend to 0
- Settings
	- Water damage/mutate
- Setup menu
- Fix thrashing
- Particles

BUGS
- Can't click through statistics element
- Fix positions for different screen dimentions
- terainUpdate variable







- How hard is the machine learning cw?
- Are they expecting us to have finished out projects completely by the presentation?
